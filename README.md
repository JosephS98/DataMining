**Title:** Alzheimer's Dataset (4 class of Images)
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented

## Requirements

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Download the dataset:** Access the dataset from the [files section labeled "Alzheimer_s Dataset"](dataset_link).

2. **Visualize different classes of images:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify distinguishing features among the different classes of MRI images.

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Apply image preprocessing techniques:** Resize, normalize, and augment the images to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Model Evaluation

1. **Compare the performance of the three models:** Evaluate based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. **Analyze strengths and weaknesses:** Assess training time, performance, and generalizability of each model.

### Discussion and Conclusion

1. **Discuss the results:** Provide insights into the behavior of the different models with this particular dataset.

2. **Conclude with recommendations:** Offer recommendations on the most effective model for predicting the stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease based on the analysis.
